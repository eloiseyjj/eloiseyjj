## 👋 Hi, I’m Yujeong Jeon

🎓 I’m currently in my final year at the University of Toronto, majoring in Economics (Data Analytics focus) and Work & Organizations, with a minor in Statistics.

📊 I love making sense of messy data, especially when it tells us something meaningful about people, work, or behavior. I'm interested in data analytics, people analytics, and marketing insights.

💡 I'm currently:
- Learning Python and pandas through real-world projects
- Analyzing my own [YouTube channel](​​www.youtube.com/@eloisej_yj) data (6K+ subs) to discover viewer behavior patterns
- Exploring how storytelling and visualization make data more impactful

📌 Projects you'll find here:
- Survey data analysis (R & Python)
- YouTube data tracking and automation
- Simple tools for creators and students

🛠️ Tools I’m using:  
`Python`, `R`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `Excel`, `SQL`, `Notion`, `Canva`, `Premiere Pro`
